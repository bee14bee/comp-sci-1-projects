brain dump exam 2 

Random numbs to rememeber: 
- first number gives you range second number gives you your starting point
rand()%(Max-min+1)min 

ex:range from 30-78
max=78 min=30
(78-30+1)+30
(48+1)+30
49+30 -> rand()%48+30

Chapter 5: Arrays

1D array syntax:

//makes array size how big you can in this case 5 and MAKE SURE ITS CONST.
int const SIZE = 5;
//declaring this variable
int arr[i];

//input
for( int i=0; i<SIZE;i++)
{
  cout<<"enter number: ";
  cin>>arr[i];
}

//displaying and dont forget to add " " at end.
for( int i=0; i<SIZE;i++)
{
  cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
}
cout endl;


2D arrays syntax:

int const ROWS = 2;
int const COLS = 5;
//put numbers the rows and cols are assign too 
int arr[2][5];

//input
for(int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++)
{
  for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++)
  {
    cout>>"Enter number for Rows: "<<r<< " Enter number for Cols: "<<c<<endl;
    cin>>arr[r][c]
  }
}

//displaying
for(int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++)
{
  for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++)
  {
    
    cout<<arr[r][c]<<" ";
  }
  cout<<endl //dont forget
}

C-string: make sure #include <c-string> in header 

strcpy: copys a string to another variable (will need a third variable as buffer) 
- ie. strcpy(variable1,variable2) then cout it as first variable them cout<"fhs"<<variable1<<endl;

strcat: compines words to make sentences
- (not cout needed just to strcat(variable,variable))  

strlen- will give the length of the sentence 
- (Use .getline with this meie. cin.getline(city,50) city is variable name is 50 is the bin)

strcmp- will compare sentences based on alpahbetecally 
- if it equals 0 they are the same <0 it comes first else the other one comes first (must be in done is if else)

//remember i for int
atoi- turns character into int value (make new variable and assign it using = atoi(variable name);)

//remember f for float/double
atof- turn character into double value (make new variable and assign it using = afoi(variable name);)


Chapter 6: Functions

Two types of functions

Voids and data type 

Voids: Used when you want to display something 

syntax: void printWord()                                                                                              
        {
        cout<<"Hello world";
        }

        in main()
        printWord();

Variable type: 

Int arraySum(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b
}

in main ()

int x,y;

cout<<"Enter 2 numbers;
cin>>a>>b;

int result=arraySum(x,y)
cout>>"Result: "<<result;

For functions should only do inputs and outputs in main unless thats function specific duty.
