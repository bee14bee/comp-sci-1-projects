2. Sum Printer Function (no arrays)

Write a program that:

Has a function void printSum(int a, int b) that prints the sum (does not return it).

In main(), read two integers from the user and call the function.

Focus: See how void can output directly without returning a value.

void printsum(int a,int b)
{
  cout<<a+b;
}

couting in array:

int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
    if (arr[i] % 2 == 0)
        count++;
cout << "Even numbers: " << count;

Reversing (print backwards)
for (int i = SIZE - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
