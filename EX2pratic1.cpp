/*
Practice 1: Random Guess Game (Functions Calling Functions)
Write a program that:
Has a function int getRandom() that returns a random number between 1 and 50.
Has a void compare(int guess) function that:
Calls getRandom() to get a secret number.
Prints whether the userâ€™s guess was too high, too low, or correct.
In main(), ask the user for their guess and call compare(guess).
